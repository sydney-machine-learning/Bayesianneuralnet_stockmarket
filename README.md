# Bayesian neural network  with Parallel Tempering MCMC for Stock Market Prediction

## Overview

An experimental project under Bayesian neural networks using Langevin-gradients parallel tempering MCMC [Chandra et al,2019] which could be implemented in a parallel computing environment.

The proposal here is to compare our stock price forecasting model with state-of-art neural network training algorithms (FNN-SGD and FNN-Adam)

## Sample Output

Following are some example results of MMMâ€™s stock price prediction. They are They are one-step, two-step, five-step prediction result and error analysis respectively. The grey area is the uncertainty of the prediction results.
